# HydrographicEvents
Content model for adding and editing events in the NHD. Events are informational data that are linked to the NHD using a linear referencing system on NHDFlowlines. The use of events is a key characteristic of the NHD by allowing vast amounts of scientific information to be linked to the NHD while keeping the design simple and by making advanced analysis techniques possible. 

See info on the [http://nhd.usgs.gov/tools.html#hem](Hydrography Event Management Tool)
This model is being assembled in collaboration with Sky Bristol, USGS
